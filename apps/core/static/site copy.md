Writing Space

Six minutes is all you need. You don't have to fight to set aside extensive time each day. Use the specialized "drip exercise." Generate writing that's either brand new or a continuation of a project, sequence, poem, story, or novel that you're writing.

Feedback Queue

Writing is collaborative. One of the key components of any successful writing practice is community. Give and receive short, productive, and diverse feedback through the feedback queue. Form partnerships with writers who best understand your work and move to private exchanges.

Draft and Revise

Keep track of your drafts, revise, and view feedback via the dashboard. Soon you'll even be able to generate and analyze feedback statistics with heat maps of your readers' favorite lines and the places where they stopped reading.

PromptMe helps you set aside time to write. 

Write is a verb. The simple truth is that in order to be a writer, you must write. Work, family, and other obligations become obstacles but PromptMe helps you work around them in small bursts using a specialized system developed after years of professional writing and teaching experience.
